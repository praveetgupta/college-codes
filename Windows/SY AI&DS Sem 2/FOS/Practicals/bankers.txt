Study of Bankerâ€™s algorithm
ANS:
The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It is
designed to ensure that resources are allocated to processes in a safe and deadlock-free manner. The algorithm is
primarily used in multi-process and multi-resource systems to avoid the deadlock state, where processes are unable
to proceed due to resource allocation conflicts.
Here's an overview of how the Banker's algorithm works:

1. Available Resources: The system keeps track of the total number of available resources of each type. These
resources can include memory, I/O devices, or other system resources.

2. Maximum Resource Requirement: Each process specifies its maximum resource requirement, i.e., the maximum
number of resources of each type it may need to complete its execution.

3. Currently Allocated Resources: The system keeps track of the currently allocated resources for each process.

4. Need Matrix: The system calculates the need matrix, which represents the remaining resources that each process
requires to complete its execution.

5. Safety Check: The Banker's algorithm performs a safety check to determine if a particular allocation of resources
to a process will result in a safe state or lead to a deadlock. The safety check ensures that the requested
resources can be allocated to a process without causing a deadlock, taking into account the available resources,
currently allocated resources, and the needs of other processes.

6. Resource Allocation: If the safety check passes, the requested resources are allocated to the process. If not, the
process must wait until the requested resources become available.

The Banker's algorithm guarantees that resource allocation will not result in a deadlock if the system is in a safe state.
It prevents the allocation of resources that may lead to a deadlock by checking for safety before making any allocation
decisions.
By maintaining information about the available resources, maximum resource requirements, and currently allocated
resources, the Banker's algorithm helps ensure that resources are allocated in a way that avoids deadlock and
maximizes system utilization.
It's important to note that the Banker's algorithm assumes that processes must declare their maximum resource
requirements upfront, which may not be feasible in all scenarios. Additionally, it requires the system to have complete
information about resource allocation and resource requirements, which may not always be available.
