Implement all basic commands of Linux OS
a) Commands to display text messages on screen (echo).
b) Files commands -Create, delete, copy, and move files.
c) Directory - Create, delete, copy, and move directories.
d) Input-output redirection commands.
e) Commands to archive or zip, compress and unpack files.
ANS: 
a) Commands to display text messages on the screen (echo):
echo "Hello, World!" : Displays "Hello, World!" on the screen.
b) File commands:
Create a file: touch filename.txt
Delete a file: rm filename.txt
Copy a file: cp sourcefile.txt destinationfile.txt
Move a file: mv sourcefile.txt destination/file.txt
c) Directory commands:
Create a directory: mkdir directoryname
Delete a directory: rmdir directoryname (only works if the directory is empty)
Copy a directory: cp -r sourcedirectory/ destinationdirectory/
Move a directory: mv sourcedirectory/ destination/
d) Input-output redirection commands:
Redirect output to a file: command > output.txt
Append output to a file: command >> output.txt
Redirect input from a file: command < input.txt
e) Archive or compression commands:
Create a zip archive: zip archive.zip file1.txt file2.txt
Extract files from a zip archive: unzip archive.zip
Implement following shell scripts
a) Creation and execution of shell script to display simple “Hello world”.
b) Write a shell script to read a number and find whether the number is odd or even
(Using if. else). and accept number from the user.
ANS:
a) Creation and execution of shell script to display simple "Hello world":
1. Create a file named hello.sh using terminal. (cat >> hello.sh)
2. Add the following lines:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
1. Save and close the file.
FOS Practical Programs 2
2. Make the script executable by running the command: chmod +x hello.sh
3. Execute the script by running: ./hello.sh
The output will be:
Hello, world!
b) Write a shell script to read a number and find whether the number is odd or even (using if-else) and accept the
number from the user:
1. Create a file named evenodd.sh using terminal. (cat >> evenodd.sh)
2. Add the following lines:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number: "
read number
if ((number % 2 == 0)); then
echo "$number is even."
else
echo "$number is odd."
fi
1. Save and close the file.
2. Make the script executable by running the command: chmod +x evenodd.sh
3. Execute the script by running: ./evenodd.sh
3. Write a shell script to accept two numbers from the user and add them.
ANS:
To write a shell script that accepts two numbers from the user and adds them, you can follow these steps:
1. Create a file named add_numbers.sh using terminal. (cat >> add_numbers.sh)
2. Add the following lines:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the first number: "
read num1
echo "Enter the second number: "
read num2
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"
1. Save and close the file.
2. Make the script executable by running the command: chmod +x add_numbers.sh
3. Execute the script by running: ./add_numbers.sh
